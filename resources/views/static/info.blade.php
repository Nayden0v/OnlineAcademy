    <p class="text-gray-700">
        Computer programmers are often curious people — a curiosity about how things work behind
        the scenes often sparks them to a career in programming. Have you ever wondered how it's
        possible for us to watch movies on our phones, how online dating apps work, or how Google
        can fetch the answers to our biggest questions? If so, computer programming might be the
        right fit for you.
        In addition to creating useful websites and apps, learning computer programming also offers
        a lot of benefits to the coder — honing their logic and reasoning, perseverance, and
        communication skills.
        Even though we are all dependent on technology in our daily lives, very few people know how to read and write code. So if you’re a complete beginner or an experienced non-programmer in tech, there are multiple reasons you should learn to code.
